 Connect Four – Backend Server 

A backend server for the classic **Connect Four** game, built with **Node.js** and **MySQL**.
Player 1 creates a game and gets a unique code; Player 2 joins with that code. The server manages turns, board state, win/draw detection, and game end events. Chat is external to gameplay.
